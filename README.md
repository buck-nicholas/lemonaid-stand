# lemonaid-stand

Welcome to LemonAid Stand! The goal is to sell as much lemonade as possible in 7 days! Careful, the weather will effect your customer count and their willingness to purchase.

Remember:
Ice melts!
Fruit Spoils!
Sugar can get ants!
Cups can... well cups are cups. Just don't drop any.
